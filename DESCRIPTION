Description: Companion data package to "Placental and Immune Cell DNA
    Methylation Reference Panel for Bulk Tissue Cell Composition Estimation in
    Epidemiological Studies." This package provides the signature cell type matrix
    of cell type-defining CpGs common to the 450k and EPIC microarrays for
    5 placental (cytotrophoblast, endothelial, Hofbauer, stromal, and
    syncytiotrophoblast), 6 peripheral immune (B cell, CD4T, CD8T, monocyte,
    neutrophil, and natural killer), and nucleated red blood cell types. The
    signature matrix is designed for plug and play use with EpiDISH's epidish(ref.m)
    argument, Bioconductor R package, DOI <10.18129/B9.bioc.EpiDISH>. This data
    package also includes the cell type samples used to create the matrix so
    other users can adapt it to their needs, if desired.
